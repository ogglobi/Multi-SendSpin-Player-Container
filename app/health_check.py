Container Health Check Script

Validates that the Multi Output Player container is properly configured
and ready to run. Executed during container startup by entrypoint.sh.

Tests Performed:
    1. Python Imports: Verifies Flask, SocketIO, PyYAML are available
    2. Directory Access: Checks /app/config, /app/logs, /app/data are writable
    3. Flask App: Tests basic Flask initialization and routing
    4. Audio Commands: Verifies audio player binaries exist
       - Full image: squeezelite, sendspin, and snapclient
       - Slim image (SENDSPIN_CONTAINER=1): sendspin only
    5. Port Availability: Checks if port 8095 is available

Exit Codes:
    0: All tests passed - container is healthy
    1: One or more tests failed - check output for details

Usage:
    python3 health_check.py
